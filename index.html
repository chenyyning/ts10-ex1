      </title> Welcome to the beagle world! </title>

  <body>

  <h1> Brief Introduction </h1>
    <p> The beagle is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound.
      The beagle was developed primarily for hunting hare known as beagling. Possessing a great sense
      of smell and superior tracking instincts, the beagle is the primary breed used as a detection dog
      for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is
      intelligent and is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health
      problems. </p>
        <li> This article is about the dog breed.</li>

  <h2> Appearance </h2>
  <p>  The general appearance of the beagle resembles a miniature Foxhound, but the head is broader and
      the muzzle shorter, the expression completely different and the legs shorter in proportion to the
      body. </p>
  <p> The tricolored beagle—white with large black areas and light brown shading—is the most common. </p>

  <h3> Variations </h3>
  <p>  Breed varieties
    <li>The American Kennel Club recognises two separate varieties of beagle:
